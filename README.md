# CP386 A4 - Bankers Algorithm

The bankerâ€™s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes a check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

# Motivation

The motivation behind the project was to apply the knowledge, understanding and skills learned within CP386 operating systems course to a real project problem.  

# Installation

Installation requires the C programming language library & gcc compiler (instructions to install [C in VSCode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation) and [gcc](https://preshing.com/20141108/how-to-install-the-latest-gcc-on-windows)). The program includes a MakeFile that will compile the program with the command "make runq1" with gcc installed. Compilation parameters &
